# **Guess A Number Game**

Welcome to the **Guess A Number Game**, a simple and fun command-line game where you try to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. Test your luck and logical thinking skills!

---

## **How It Works**
1. The computer picks a random number between **1** and **1000**.
2. You have **10 attempts** to guess the number correctly.
3. After each guess, youâ€™ll receive hints to guide you:
   - If your guess is too low, the game will let you know whether it's **"Too Low"** or just **"Low"**.
   - If your guess is too high, the game will respond with **"Too High"** or **"High"**.
4. If you guess the correct number, you win! ðŸŽ‰
5. If you run out of attempts, the game will reveal the correct number, and you lose. ðŸ˜¢
